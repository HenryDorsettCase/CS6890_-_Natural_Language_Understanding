CS6890_-_Natural_Language_Understanding
=======================================

Parsing, semantics, concepts, recognizing and understanding a narrative

This course is from fall 2009.  I remember being invited to join by the professor because he loves literature as well.
He covered how to write a story according to the PAM system of the early '70's by Roger Schank at Yale.

As I look back on this code, I see old habits:
- tabs instead of 4 spaces 
- {}'s for more whitepsace
- some non-descriptive magic numbers.


It was a terrific class and by it I became a better programmer and computer scientist. 
It helped me to learn Java, and prepared me up for my AI research.
